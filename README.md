# UD_01_Portfolio

# What an improvement

I recently upgraded my original contribution, HW02_portfolio, and left a lot of things on the table.  I'm happy to work a bit more on it and feature the latest triumph: Route My Day.  This was my first group project

# Assets

HTML, CSS, bootstrap, W3 Schools, entheosweb.com (collage https://www.entheosweb.com/tutorials/css/collage_gallery.asp), jquery-az.com (carousel https://www.jquery-az.com/boots/demo.php?ex=18.0_1)

# In this version

Major improvements in this version include:
Greater responsiveness, but still can be improved
Addition of Resume section
"Collage" to enhance aesthetics of the aside

"Carousel" WITH CLICKABLE LINKS TO PROJECTS to make it more interesting to view projects

#SUMMARY

Yes, I am very proud of finding a carousel, properly installing it, then finding a way to make the images point to the corresponding projects!  CSS and html are coming together for me!  I'm looking forward to learning even more about JS!
